<h1>H is for Hawk</h1>
<h2>Helen Macdonald</h2>
<h3>H is for Hawk tells Macdonald's story of the year she spent training a
    northern goshawk in the wake of her father's death. Her father, Alisdair Macdonald,
    was a respected photojournalist who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2007. Having been
    a falconer for many years, she purchased a young goshawk to help her through the grieving process.
